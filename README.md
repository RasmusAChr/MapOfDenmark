# Map of Denmark
Map of Denmark is an application developed to visualize the map of Denmark using data from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This project demonstrates the application of knowledge from the first two semesters of the BSc in Software Development at the IT-University in Copenhagen. It showcases the selection and implementation of relevant tools and algorithms for mapping and pathfinding tasks.

## Introduction
Map of Denmark is a simple mapping application designed to visualize Denmark based on OSM data. The project was developed during the 2nd semester of the BSc in Software Development. It demonstrates the use of various algorithms and data structures, including Dijkstra's algorithm for pathfinding, KD-tree for spatial data structures, and Trie structures for efficient data handling.

## Features
* Visualize maps of Denmark using OSM data.
* Pathfinding with Dijkstra's algorithm.
* Spatial data structures using kD-tree.
* Efficient data handling with Trie and space-optimized prefix Trie.

## Loading maps
Once the program has started, you can load a map of Denmark or a custom map file:

### Load Denmark Map:
**This doesnt work as of right now, due difficulties on uploading large files.**
1. Press the “Load Denmark” button to load the default map of Denmark.

### Choose Custom File:
1. Press the “Choose custom file” button to select and load a custom map.
2. Supported file formats: .osm, .zip (containing .osm), and .obj.
Note: .obj files must be created by this application to avoid errors.
